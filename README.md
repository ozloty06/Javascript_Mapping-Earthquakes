# Mapping_Earthquakes
> an analysis of maps

### Resources
- Javascript ES6 with Data-Driven Documents (D3) library
- Leaflet 1.7.1 and Mapbox v2.3.1
- GeoJSON data

### Summary
Visually demonstrate worldwide earthquake data and tectonic plates information on a visually appealing map using Javascript and D3 library. Earthquake content was provided using GeoJSON data from USGS website and included geographic coordinates and magnitudes for earthquakes of varying magnitude for the last seven days.

Used D3.js library to retrieve coordinates and magitudes of earthquakes from GeoJSON data and plotted on a Mapbox map using Leftlet library through API request. The result is an interactive map of earthquake data with varied background map layer options, including satellite, streets, and light views. Additionally, tectonic plate boundaries and earthquake locations, both major and others, can be toggled on/off in the view. Lastly, each earthquake from the prior 7 days can be selected to view magnitude and location of the earthquake with the map styling visually indicating magitude with colors and a representative circle radius.
